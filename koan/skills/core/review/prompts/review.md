# Code Review

You are performing a code review on a pull request. Your goal is to provide
actionable, constructive feedback that helps the author improve the code.

## Pull Request: {TITLE}

## Your Task

Analyze the code changes and produce a structured review. Focus on:

1. **Correctness** — Logic bugs, edge cases, off-by-one errors, race conditions
2. **Security** — Injection, authentication gaps, data exposure, unsafe operations
3. **Architecture** — Design issues, coupling, abstraction level, naming
4. **Maintainability** — Readability, complexity, test coverage gaps

### Output Format

Your ENTIRE response must be a single valid JSON object (no markdown, no code fences, no text before or after). The JSON must conform to this schema:

```json
{
  "file_comments": [
    {
      "file": "path/to/file.py",
      "line_start": 42,
      "line_end": 42,
      "severity": "critical",
      "title": "Short issue title",
      "comment": "Detailed explanation of the issue and suggested fix.",
      "code_snippet": "relevant code or empty string"
    }
  ],
  "review_summary": {
    "lgtm": false,
    "summary": "Final assessment paragraph.",
    "checklist": [
      {
        "item": "No hardcoded secrets",
        "passed": true,
        "finding_ref": ""
      },
      {
        "item": "Input validation at boundaries",
        "passed": false,
        "finding_ref": "critical #1"
      }
    ]
  },
  "comment_replies": [
    {
      "comment_id": 12345,
      "reply": "Detailed reply explaining why and how."
    }
  ]
}
```

(Omit `close_pr` entirely unless you are closing — see Field rules below.)

Field rules:

Example of an LGTM review (no issues, no replies):

```json
{
  "file_comments": [],
  "review_summary": {
    "lgtm": true,
    "summary": "Clean implementation. No issues found. Merge-ready.",
    "checklist": []
  },
  "comment_replies": []
}
```
