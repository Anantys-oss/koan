# Skills Reference

> **New here?** Start with the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) — a 5-minute, copy-paste guide to the most-used commands across GitHub, Jira, and your messaging app.
>
> **For a guided introduction**, see the [User Manual](user-manual.md) — organized by skill level with use cases and workflow examples.

Complete reference for all Koan slash commands. Use these via Telegram, Slack, or GitHub @mentions.

> **Extensible:** Drop a `SKILL.md` in `instance/skills/` or install from a Git repo with `/skill install <url>`.
> See [koan/skills/README.md](../../koan/skills/README.md) for the authoring guide.

## Code & Project Operations

| Command | Aliases | Description | GitHub @mention |
|---------|---------|-------------|:-:|
| `/plan [--iterations N] <desc>` | — | Deep-think an idea, create a tracker issue with task-level plan (file map, checkbox steps, code blocks, self-review). `--iterations N` (1-5) runs N critique+refine rounds. | — |
| `/deepplan <desc>` | `/deeplan` | Spec-first design: explore approaches, post spec, queue /plan | — |
| `/implement <issue>` | `/impl` | Queue implementation for a GitHub or Jira issue; creates a draft PR, then privately reviews/fixes Important+ findings by default | Yes |
| `/fix <issue>` | — | Diagnose → understand → plan → test → implement → submit PR, then privately reviews/fixes Important+ findings by default. Use `--skip-diagnose` to bypass the diagnostic. A PR URL is redirected to `/rebase` (preserving `--now` and trailing context) | Yes |
| `/debug <issue>` | `/dbg` | Structured 4-step debug loop: reproduce → hypothesize → minimal fix → verify. Auto-queued when `/fix` fails (opt-in via `debug_escalation.on_fix_failure` in config.yaml) | Yes |
| `/review <PR> [PR ...] [--bot-comments]` | `/rv` | Review one or more pull requests; each URL queues a separate review mission. `--bot-comments` triages bot findings | Yes |
| `/ultrareview <PR>` | `/urv` | Ultra-thorough review: architecture + silent-failure passes combined | Yes |
| `/explain <PR>` | `/xp` | Explain a PR's changes in plain language with examples and alternative approaches | Yes |
| `/rebase <PR> [focus area]` | `/rb` | Rebase a PR onto its base branch; trailing text after the URL is threaded into the mission as focus context | Yes |
| `/squash <PR>` | `/sq` | Squash all PR commits into one clean commit | Yes |
| `/recreate <PR>` | `/rc` | Re-implement a PR from scratch on a fresh branch | Yes |
| `/refactor <desc>` | `/rf` | Targeted refactoring mission | Yes |
| `/check <url>` | `/inspect` | Run project health checks on a PR or issue (rebase, review, plan) | — |
| `/check_need <url>` | `/need`, `/needs` | Analyze if a PR or issue is still needed vs. current main | — |
| `/ci_check <PR>\|--enable\|--disable` | — | Check and fix CI failures on a PR (non-blocking, bounded, one attempt per mission); toggle CI system | — |
| `/pr <PR>` | — | Review and update a GitHub pull request | — |
| `/claudemd [project]` | `/claude`, `/claude.md` | Refresh or create a project's CLAUDE.md | — |
| `/doc <project> [cats]` | `/docs` | Extract structured documentation to docs/ | Yes |
| `/profile <project>` | `/perf`, `/benchmark` | Performance profiling mission | Yes |

For URL-based `/plan`, `/deepplan`, `/implement`, and `/fix`, append `branch:<name>` to
override the base branch for that mission.

The private post-PR review gate for `/fix`, `/implement`, and `/rebase` is
backend-only: it reuses `/review` analysis, fixes Blocking/Important findings
on the same branch, and does not post review comments or verdicts. It is
opt-in (disabled by default during the testing phase) — enable and configure it
with `private_review_gate` in `config.yaml` or `projects.yaml`.

`/review` (and the private gate) inject the project's filtered learnings and
human-curated context/priorities into the review prompt, ranked against the PR
content. Enable `review_memory` in `config.yaml` to also include recent typed
project memory (decisions, observations) from the SQLite memory index.

**Inline comments (opt-in):** Set `review_inline_comments.enabled: true` in
`config.yaml` to also post each finding as an inline PR comment anchored to its
code location, in addition to the bucketed summary comment (which is unchanged).
Each inline thread shows the same severity marker (🔴/🟡/🟢) and the full finding
detail, so reviewers can react or resolve in place. Cap the volume with
`review_inline_comments.max_comments` (default 25). Re-running `/review` is
idempotent (already-anchored findings are skipped); multi-line findings anchor
to their full range; if all posts fail, you are notified. Disabled by default.

**Stale-HEAD alert:** the review comment's footer shows the commit it was run
against (`HEAD=<short-sha>`). A review can take minutes, and you may push (or
force-push) new commits meanwhile. If the branch tip moved between when the
review started and when the comment is posted, Kōan appends an **IMPORTANT**
banner to the comment noting that the findings predate your latest push — so you
don't act on stale feedback. Re-run `/review` to cover the new commits. Nothing
changes for the common case where the branch didn't move.

**Large diffs & partial-coverage warning:** Review diffs are packed to fit a
token budget by the diff compressor (`optimizations.review_compressor.token_budget`,
default 80,000 tokens — the single knob controlling review diff size). The
fetch-time character cap is *derived* from that budget (budget × 3.5 chars/token
× 4 headroom), so the compressor — not a blind character cut — decides coverage
on large-context models. If the compressor is disabled, a token-safe backstop
(budget × 3.5, no headroom) truncates the diff instead, so the size guard holds
in every config. Whenever any file is omitted (fetch-time backstop,
compressor packing, or trivial-file triage), the posted review opens with a
`⚠️ Partial review` block listing every omitted file, so partial coverage is
never silent.

Skills marked **GitHub @mention** can be triggered by commenting `@koan-bot <command>` on a PR or issue. See [GitHub commands](../messaging/github-commands.md).

## Skill Types

- **Instant** (`worker: false`) — Executes immediately, returns a response. Examples: `/status`, `/list`, `/gha_audit`.
- **Worker** (`worker: true`) — Runs in a background thread (Claude calls, API requests). Examples: `/magic`, `/chat`, `/sparring`.
- **Hybrid** (`audience: hybrid`) — Available from both Telegram/Slack and as agent-dispatched skills. Examples: `/plan`, `/implement`, `/review`.

## Custom Skills

Install skills from Git repos:

```
/skill install https://github.com/your-org/koan-skills.git
/skill approve <scope> <fingerprint>
/skill update <scope>
/skill remove <scope>
```

New installs and `/scaffold_skill` output are **quarantined** behind an
approval gate — the registry will not load them until `/skill approve` is run
with the fingerprint shown in the install reply. Inspect the cloned files
before approving. Set `skills.allowed_hosts` in `config.yaml` to restrict
which Git hosts `/skill install` can fetch from.

Or create your own in `instance/skills/<scope>/<name>/` with a `SKILL.md` file. See [koan/skills/README.md](../../koan/skills/README.md) for the full authoring guide.
